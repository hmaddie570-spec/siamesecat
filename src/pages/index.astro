      <h2>Care</h2>
      <p>
        Caring for a Siamese cat involves providing a balanced diet, regular
        exercise, and routine veterinary care. Siamese cats have short coats that
        require minimal grooming, but regular brushing can help reduce shedding and
        keep their coat healthy. It's important to provide mental stimulation and
        interactive play to keep them engaged. Siamese cats are prone to certain
        health issues, so regular check-ups with a veterinarian are essential to
        ensure their well-being.
